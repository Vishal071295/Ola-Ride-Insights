The rise of ride-sharing platforms has transformed urban mobility, offering convenience and affordability to millions of users. OLA, a leading ride-hailing service, generates vast amounts of data related to ride bookings, driver availability, fare calculations, and customer preferences. However, deriving actionable insights from this data remains a challenge. To enhance operational efficiency, improve customer satisfaction, and optimize business strategies, this project focuses on analyzing OLAâ€™s ride-sharing data. By leveraging data analytics, visualization techniques, and interactive applications, the goal is to extract meaningful insights that can drive data-informed decisions. The project will involve cleaning and processing raw ride data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), developing a dynamic Power BI dashboard, and creating a Streamlit-based web application to present key findings in an interactive and user-friendly manner.
